 Compute Services on AWS
 -------





Amazon EC2 
---

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable computecapacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

---

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
---

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and lets you automatically add or remove EC2 instances using scaling policies that you define.Dynamic or predictive scaling policies let you add or remove EC2 instance capacity to service established or real-time  demand patterns.

---

Amazon load balance 
---

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets and virtual appliances in one or more Availability Zones (AZs).

Amazon EBS volumes
---


An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your instances. After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it as you would use a physical hard drive.

---

AWS Lambda
---

Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk
---

With AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.

Amazon S3
---


Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its e-commerce network

Amazon CloudFront
---

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (Amazon CDN or Amazon CDN Services) that is operated by Amazon Web Services. It speeds up the distribution of your static and dynamic web content such as .html, .css, .js, and image files to your clientele. This introduces you to Amazon CloudFront and helps you get started with it by talking about its working, benefits, use cases, and pricing. Finally, we also help you set up your CloudFront Distribution and get started with it.

AWS Simple Notification Service
---


In simple terms, AWS Simple Notification Service (or AWS SNS) is a cloud-based web service that delivers messages. In other words, the AWS SNS service coordinates and manages the delivery of push messages to clients or subscribed endpoints.

AWS RDS 
---

Amazon RDS allows you to encrypt your databases using keys you manage through AWS Key Management Service (KMS). On a database instance 
running with Amazon RDS encryption, data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted, as are its automated backups, read replicas,snapshots.

Amazon Machine Images (AMI)
---


An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a supported and maintained image provided by AWS that provides the information required to launch an instance. 
You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance.
