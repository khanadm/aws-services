 Compute Services on AWS
 -------




Amazon EC2 
---

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable computecapacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

---



Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
---

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and lets you automatically add or remove EC2 instances using scaling policies that you define.Dynamic or predictive scaling policies let you add or remove EC2 instance capacity to service established or real-time  demand patterns.

Amazon EBS volumes
---


An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your instances. After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it as you would use a physical hard drive.

---



AWS Lambda
---

Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service.

---



AWS RDS 
---

Amazon RDS allows you to encrypt your databases using keys you manage through AWS Key Management Service (KMS). On a database instance 
running with Amazon RDS encryption, data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted, as are its automated backups, read replicas,snapshots.

Amazon Machine Images (AMI)
---


An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a supported and maintained image provided by AWS that provides the information required to launch an instance. 
You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance.
