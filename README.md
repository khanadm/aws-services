 Compute Services on AWS
 -------





Amazon EC2 
---

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable computecapacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
---

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and lets you automatically add or remove EC2 instances using scaling policies that you define.Dynamic or predictive scaling policies let you add or remove EC2 instance capacity to service established or real-time  demand patterns.

Amazon load balance 
---

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets and virtual appliances in one or more Availability Zones (AZs).

Amazon EBS volumes
---


An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your instances. After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it as you would use a physical hard drive.

AWS Lambda
---

Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service.
